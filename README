How does stress affect multigenerational families 
I would like to know how stressful situations affects families who are providing care to multiple generations. Often, these couples are called the "sandwich generation", and can include the care of young children and older loved ones.  
How can families become resilient from stressful situations
I would also like to know how families who endure highly stressful situations can be resilient and thrive from those situations.
How is the married couple directly involved in the transition of an older loved one affected by caregiving responsibilities
Finally, I would like to know how the couple directly involved with the caregiving duties of an older family member can affect the relationship of the couple. Caregiving duties can include anything from providing direct care (i.e., bathing, dressing, etc.) to informational and/or emotional care in the transition out of the home and into a residential care facility.
